### Generating a token

The following CURL command allows you to test generating an access token:

```
curl -X POST "https://your-api-gateway-url/oauth2/token" \
     -H "Authorization: Basic $(echo -n 'your-client-id:your-client-secret' | base64)" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
     -d "grant_type=client_credentials" \
     -d "scope=cars-service/create.order"
```
